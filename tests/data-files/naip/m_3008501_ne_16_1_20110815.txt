    Description:
      Abstract:
        This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture
        Imagery Program (NAIP).  NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery
        during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S..
        A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of
        of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. NAIP provides
        four main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho
        imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 5
        meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from
        the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP); 2 meter GSD
        ortho imagery rectified to within +/- 10 meters of reference
        DOQQs; 1 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified to within +/- 6
        meters to true ground; and, 2 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified
        to within +/- 10 meters to true ground.  The tiling format of
        NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle
        with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides.  NAIP quarter quads
        are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83.  NAIP
        imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.
      Purpose:
        NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days
        of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current
        information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm
        programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter GSD product
        provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and
        other data sets.  The 1 meter NAIP imagery is generally acquired
        in projects covering full states in cooperation with state
        government and other federal agencies who use the imagery for a
        variety of purposes including land use planning and natural
        resource assessment.  With an annual cycle, NAIP is also used
        for disaster response often providing the most current pre-event
        imagery.  While suitable for a variety of uses the 2 meter
        GSD NAIP imagery is primarily intended to assess crop condition
        and compliance to USDA farm program conditions.  The 2
        meter imagery is generally acquired only for agricultural areas
        within state projects.

    Access_Constraints: There are no limitations for access.
    Use_Constraints:
      Imagery may be replaced to address defects found in a
      small number of products through quality assurance
      processes.  Imagery containing defects that require
      the acquisition of new imagery, such as excessive
      cloud cover, specular reflectance, etc., will not be
      replaced within a NAIP project year.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Digital frames captured with a ZI Intergraph DMC with a 
          footprint of 7680 x 13824 pixels were used to create Digital 
          Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles.  DMC Serial Numbers 001, 013, 033 and 137 
          installed in a Rockwell 690A Turbo Commander, a Gulfstream 840 Commander, 
          a Rockwell 690B Turbo Commander, and a Piper Cheyenne 1; 
          N771BA, N910FC, N167R, and N400CM were used to fly this area at 28,900'.    
          Calibration reports are on file with the USDA.  There are four 
          camera heads which correspond to the bands captured.  Their 
          general spectral ranges are Blue: 400nm-580nm; 
          Green: 500nm-650nm; Red: 590nm-675nm; and 
          NIR: 675nm-850nm.  12 micron frames were captured at eight bits 
          with 2.5 - 2.7 foot pixel using Windows Server 2003; 
          ZI Mission Planning 6.2; Intergraph GeoMedia 6.0; DMC Image 
          Analyst 6.2; DMC Post Processing 6.1; ZI Image Viewer 6.1; 
          Microsoft Access; Microsoft Excel; Delorme XMap 4.5 and Adobe 
          PhotoShop. Flights ASL was 28,900 feet. The state was flown in 
          blocks for efficiency of capture and in order to accommodate 
          the different elevations throughout the state.  The camera 
          firmware version is 2.1.  Flight planning software includes 
          Delorme 4.5; Delorme Photo Flight 2.1.6; ZI Inflight 
          V06.01.20.16; ZI ImageView V06.01.20.16 ; ArcView 3.2; 
          Microsoft Access; and POSAV 2.1.  Ground control points were 
          collected by Photo Science crews.  External Orientation files 
          created from ABGPS data in Applanix POSPac MMS Version 5.2 
          and are rectified using ImageStation Project Manager 5.2; 
          Intergraph GeoMedia 6.0; and Intergraph OrthoPro 5.2.  
          Extensive Quality Control checks are performed on the data 
          throughout the production process.  Processed RAW Frames are 
          checked for spectral compliance.  Rectified frames are checked 
          for spatial accuracy and also spectral compliance. DOQQs are 
          thoroughly checked for spectral and spatial accuracy in Iras/C 
          and Adobe PhotoShop. CCMs are checked for overall spectral 
          compliance and spatial accuracy in ArcGIS.  Seamline shapefiles 
          are checked for gaps, slivers, overlaps and multipart features 
          by building a topology in ArcGIS.  Ground control points are 
          read off of rectified frames as a double-check and final DOQQs 
          are used to calculate RMSE values in MicroStation and Excel.  
          Frames are rectified with 10 meter NEDs in Intergraph OrthoPro.
          This surface is checked for errors at the mosaicked DOQQ level.
          If any areas presented problems, they are noted in a Digital 
          Elevation Model Errors ASCII text file.
