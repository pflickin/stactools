    Description:
      Abstract:
        This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture
        Imagery Program (NAIP).  The NAIP program is administered by
        USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA
        strategic goals centered on agricultural production.
        These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources
        while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities
        are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to
        increase food security.  The NAIP program supports these goals by
        acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected
        during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP
        ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a
        fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation
        programs.  Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive
        means of communication about farm program administration
        between FSA and stakeholders.
        New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and
        maintaining a relationship with vendors and government
        partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial
        community.  As a result of these efforts the NAIP program
        provides three main products: DOQQ tiles,
        Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files
        The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed
        over time reflecting agency requirements and improving
        technologies.  These changes include image resolution,
        horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands.
        In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are
        targeted for peak crop growing conditions.  The NAIP
        acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year refresh of base
        ortho imagery.  The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based
        on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer
        on all four sides.  NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM
        coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983.
        NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.
      Purpose:
        NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days
        of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current
        information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm
        programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter
        GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit
        boundaries and other data sets.  The 1 meter and 1/2 meter NAIP
        imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in
        cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that
        use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use
        planning and natural resource assessment.  The NAIP is also used
        for disaster response.  While suitable for a variety of uses,
        prior to 2007 the 2 meter GSD NAIP imagery was primarily intended
        to assess "crop condition and compliance" to USDA farm program
        conditions. The 2 meter imagery was generally acquired only
        for agricultural areas within state projects.

        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
          NAIP horizontal accuracy specifications have evolved over
          the life of the program.  From 2003 to 2004 the
          specifications were as follows: 1-meter GSD imagery was
          to match within 3-meters, and 2-meter GSD to match within 10
          meters of reference imagery.  For 2005 the 1-meter GSD
          specification was changed to 5 meters matching the reference
          imagery.  In 2006 a pilot project was performed using true
          ground specifications rather than reference imagery.  All
          states used the same specifications as 2005 except Utah,
          which required a match of +/- 6 meters to true ground.
          In 2007 all specifications were the same as 2006 except
          Arizona used true ground specifications and all other states
          used reference imagery.  In 2008 and subsequent years
          no 2-meter GSD imagery was acquired and all specifications
          were the same as 2007 except approximately half of the
          states acquired used true ground specifications and the
          other half used reference imagery.  The 2008 states that
          used absolute ground control where; Indiana, Minnesota,
          New Hampshire, North Carolina, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.
          From 2009 to present all NAIP imagery acquisitions used
          the +/- 6 meters to ground specification.
